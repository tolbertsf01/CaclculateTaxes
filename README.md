# CaclculateTaxes
The project calculates the 2020 Federal Income Tax Brackets and rates for single and married filing jointly groups based on an annual taxable income (yearly salary).  It shows how the annual taxable income is broken down into each tax bracket and provides the total tax amount per bracket based on the tax bracket rate.
